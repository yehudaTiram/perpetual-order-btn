Shortcode to display a button for customer to order again the same predefined order. Set a predefined perpetual order for your customers that they can activate in one click. The plugin creates a shortcode that can be assigned in any part of the site (widgets or template) and displays a button for adding all the predefined order's items to the cart. You can set for each customer one of his existing orders as perpetual in the customer profile. Then a button will shoe in the shortcode's place for these customers. The customer can now click this button and all the products from the predefined order will be added to the cart. Use [perpetual-order] as the shortcode.
